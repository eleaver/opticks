/**
 *  A plug-in shell class for creating dock windows.
 *
 *  This class provides capabilities to create a dock window in the main
 *  application window.  A dock window plug-in is executed on application
 *  startup and when a new session is created.  The execute() method creates
 *  the dock window with the same name as the plug-in and hides it by default.
 *
 *  Subclasses are only responsible for implementing the following items:
 *  - Creating the action that toggles the display of the dock window and
 *    adding it to a menu and/or toolbar in an override of the createAction()
 *    method.
 *  - Creating the widget that is used as the dock window contents in an
 *    override of the createWidget() method.
 *  - Removing the action from a menu and/or toolbar in the subclass destructor.
 *    Do not delete the action if it is parented to \c this.
 *
 *  Subclasses do not need to destroy the contents widget since it is
 *  automatically destroyed when the dock window is destroyed.
