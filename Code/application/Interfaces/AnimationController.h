/**
 *  Plays one or more animations synchronously.
 *
 *  An animation controller allows multiple animations to be played synchronously at a particular
 *  rate.  This can be particularly useful with time-based controllers.  In addition to
 *  the animations, the controller stores a start value, stop value, and current value.  These
 *  values are updated automatically when the frames in an animation change, or when an
 *  animation is destroyed.  The start value is defined as the minimum value across all
 *  frames in all animations according to the frame value type specified at the creation
 *  of the controller.  Similarly, the stop value is defined as the maximum value across
 *  all frames in all animations according to the controller's frame value type.  Animations must
 *  be created within the animation controller, which guarantees that the animation and the controller
 *  will have the same frame type.
 *
 *  When playing animations, each animation is updated at a constant frequency, specified by
 *  getFrequency().  This means that rate at which Animation::setCurrentFrame() is called
 *  does not change.  The value that is passed to the animation when the current frame is
 *  set can be modified by changing the interval multiplier.  This has the effect of
 *  speeding up or slowing down the animations.
 *
 *  The frame rate is based on the frequency and the interval multiplier.  In some cases
 *  the desired frame rate cannot be achieved due to limitations in the hardware.  If
 *  this occurs, frames will be dropped when playing through the animations to preserve the
 *  integrity of the frame rate.
 *
 *  An animation controller is created and destroyed from the animation window.  When an animation controller
 *  is destroyed, all animations contained in the controller are also destroyed.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *    - The controller is deleted.
 *    - The following methods are called: createAnimation(), insertAnimation(),
 *      setCurrentFrame(), setIntervalMultiplier(), setAnimationState(),
 *      setAnimationCycle(), removeAnimation(), and destroyAnimation().
 *    - The frame set in one of the animations changes.
 *    - Other notifications documented in the Subject class.
