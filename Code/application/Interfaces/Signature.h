 * Signature with identifying attributes

 * A signature is an object that essentially consists of a map of data sets, along with a map of
 * optional Units objects. Each data set is referred to as a component of the signature.
 * The unique name associated with each data set is called its component name and is the key for
 * the map of data sets. The optional Units object associated with a data set is stored in a map using the
 * data set component name as the key.
 *
 * This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 * - The following method is called: setData().
 * - Everything else documented in DataElement.
