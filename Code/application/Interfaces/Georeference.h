    *  Determines if this georeferencing algorithm can be used for a given
    *  raster data descriptor.
    *
    *  A Georeference plug-in must implement this method to provide information
    *  about whether it supports a given raster data set, which is similar to
    *  the functionality of Importer::getFileAffinity().
    *
    *  This method is called automatically on import if auto-georeferencing is
    *  enabled and after import when the user manually georeferences the raster
    *  data.
    *
    *  The following code demonstrates how a georeference plug-in can optionally
    *  not support georeferencing on import but support georeferencing after
    *  import:
    *  \code
    *  unsigned char MyGeoreferencePlugIn::getGeoreferenceAffinity(const RasterDataDescriptor* pDescriptor) const
    *  {
    *     // Check if the raster element is loaded, which indicates georeferencing after import.
    *     if (Service<ModelServices>()->getElement(pDescriptor) != NULL)
    *     {
    *        return Georeference::CAN_GEOREFERENCE;
    *     }
    *
    *     // The raster element is not loaded, which indicates georeferencing on import.
    *     return Georeference::CAN_NOT_GEOREFERENCE;
    *  }
    *  \endcode
    *
    *  @param   pDescriptor
    *           The raster data descriptor to test.
    *
    *  @return  Typically returns one of the following values, however any
    *           unsigned char value can be returned if a specific Georeference
    *           plug-in requires more granularity.
    *           <ul>
    *             <li>Georeference::CAN_NOT_GEOREFERENCE</li>

    *             <li>Georeference::CAN_GEOREFERENCE</li>
    *           </ul>
    *           A Georeference plug-in can return a value greater than
    *           Georeference::CAN_GEOREFERENCE if it wishes to override another
    *           plug-in that can georeference the raster data.  For example, the
    *           RPC %Georeference plug-in may override the GCP %Georeference
    *           plug-in if the georeferencing will be more accurate.
