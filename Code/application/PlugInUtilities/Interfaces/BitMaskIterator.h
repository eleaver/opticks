/**
 * Traverses selected pixels within a BitMask.
 * This class provides a convenient way to traverse the selected pixels within a
 * given area of a BitMask object.  The BitMaskIterator extents can be set to either
 * custom values or the extents of a RasterElement.

 *  \image html BitMaskIteratorExample1.jpg
 *  \image html BitMaskIteratorExample2.jpg
 *
 * The iterator incorporates the outside flag of the BitMask when determining
 * whether a pixel is selected.  The getPixel(int,int) const method is provided to
 * query the selected state of any pixel within the extents. A call to getPixel() for
 * pixel locations outside the extents of the BitMasKIterator will return false.
 *
 *  \image html BitMaskIteratorExample3.jpg
 *  \image html BitMaskIteratorExample4.jpg
 *
 * This class is intended to be used in place of directly traversing the
 * BitMask.
 *
 * @warning    The iterator does not assume ownership over the BitMask.  It is
 *             intended to be used in place of directly traversing the BitMask.
 *             Also for efficiency purposes, this class assumes that the BitMask
 *             is valid (i.e. not deleted) throughout the lifetime of the
 *             iterator.
